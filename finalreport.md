## Final Report
### Introduction
Why was it chosen? Why is it cool? Discuss the general/broader impact of having a good predictive mode. i.e. why is this important? (3 points)

Have you ever sat down to watch a movie and struggled to decide which one might actually be worth your time? This everyday dilemma reflects a much larger challenge in the film industry: predicting which movies will perform well and resonate with audiences. That's why we chose to use the [Wykonos Movies Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wykonos/movies) to develop a predictive model that predicts movie performance based on 20 attributes that ranged from financial measures like budget and revenue to cultural markers like genre and runtime. With over 700k movies in this dataset, the variety of films mirrors the real-world diversity of the film industry. Not only does predicting movie performance connect to a topic lots of people are passionate about, it also generates data-driven insights with practical value for the entertainment and media industries. For film studios and streaming platforms, predictive insights can guide decisions on how to target marketing and how to anticipate audience preferences based on the types of movies they make/sell. For audiences, this predictive model highlights the quantitative factors that influence success in a very subjective industry. On a smaller scale, this kind of model could help everyday viewers decide which movie is worth watching on a given night.

### Figures
Your report should include relevant figures of your choosing to help with the narration of your story, including legends (similar to a scientific paper). For reference you search machine learning and your model in google scholar for reference examples.  (3 points)

### Methods
This section will include the exploration results, preprocessing steps, models chosen in the order they were executed. You should also describe the parameters chosen. Please make sub-sections for every step. i.e Data Exploration, Preprocessing, Model 1, Model 2, additional models are optional. Please note that models can be the same i.e. DNN but different versions of it if they are distinct enough. Changes can not be incremental. You can put links here to notebooks and/or code blocks using three ` in markup for displaying code. so it would look like this: ``` MY CODE BLOCK ```

Note: A methods section does not include any why. the reason why will be in the discussion section. This is just a summary of your methods  (5 points)
